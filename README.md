# Clustering with KMeans
Clustering is a nice way to show the similarities between data points. In this project, I decided to compare venues and POIs from two different cities in the World; Manhattan and Paris. In order to achieve this, I used SKlearn KMeans to create the clusters and Beautiful Soup to extract the data. You can find the attached presentation of the project as well as the code itself.
This project was used as the last Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Proffesional Certification.
